	    	In addition to my studies, I invest my time in student associations.
	    	I'm a former member of the student union and I'm the director of human
	    	ressources at the school Junior enterprise. Moreover, I also founded
	    	an associations to teach the japanese to the other students of the school
	    	and maybe the whole campus from september 2019.

	    	During the remaining time, I'm happy to hangout with my friends,
	    	read mangas, drink a cup of delicious tea or do sports.
